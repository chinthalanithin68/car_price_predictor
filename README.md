# Refurbished Car Price Predictor ðŸš—ðŸ’°

A Streamlit web application that predicts the estimated price of a refurbished car based on user inputs such as car model, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, and transmission. The app uses a machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor) trained on a dataset of refurbished cars.

## âœ¨ Features

- **User-friendly Input Form:** Enter car details through an intuitive sidebar interface.
- **Price Prediction:** Uses a trained Random Forest Regression model to estimate the selling price of a refurbished car.
- **Dynamic Progress Bar:** Displays a loading animation while predicting.
- **Search Link:** Provides a direct Google search link to explore more about the car model.
- **Similar Cars:** Displays similar cars from the dataset within the predicted price range for comparison.
- **Expandable Sections:** Additional information about the app, features, and instructions.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset (`car_data.csv`) containing the following features:

- `Car_Name`
- `Year`
- `Kms_Driven`
- `Fuel_Type`
- `Seller_Type`
- `Transmission`
- `Selling_Price` (target variable)

Irrelevant columns like `Owner` and `Present_Price` are dropped during preprocessing.

## ðŸ¤– Model

- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor
- **Preprocessing:**
  - One-hot encoding for categorical features: `Car_Name`, `Fuel_Type`, `Seller_Type`, `Transmission`
  - Numerical features are used directly.
- **Train-Test Split:** 80% training, 20% testing
- **Implementation:** All preprocessing and modeling steps are combined using a scikit-learn Pipeline for efficiency and reproducibility.
